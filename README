Bronze Thistle 
A 'toy' Roomserver / Edgeserver implementation,
for experimentation with client ideas, distributed objects,
and other topics of interest.

Components:

* broker
    Maintains a HornetQ instance so that back-end systems can talk
    to each other.

* client
    A trivial client application, hopefully to be replaced with a 
    less trivial client application as things get off the ground.

* entity container
    handles management of the distributed entities.  
    NOTE: likely to be replaced or augmented by a distributed 
    cache such as Terracotta.

* messages
    definitions of message and entity objects which are shared
    between the client and the zoneserver.

* zoneserver
    provides socket services to the client and manages the 'room'
    details for the 'game'.
